# Recipe Finder Application

This is a React-based application designed to search and display recipes based on the selected ingredients. The app fetches recipe data from an external API and presents it in an interactive interface. Users can search for recipes by ingredient, apply filters, view recipe details, and get a list of ingredients used in each recipe.

## Features

- **Ingredient Search**: Users can search for recipes based on ingredients.
- **Recipe Cards**: Display recipe information in a visually appealing card format.
- **Recipe Details Modal**: View detailed recipe instructions and ingredients in a modal.
- **Error Handling**: Inform users if no recipes are found or if thereâ€™s an issue fetching data.
- **Loading State**: Show a loading spinner while recipes are being fetched.
- **Filter Sidebar**: (Future functionality) Filters to refine recipe search based on categories like cuisine type, diet, etc.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **API**: Fetch recipes from a public API (e.g., TheMealDB API)
- **State Management**: React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks
